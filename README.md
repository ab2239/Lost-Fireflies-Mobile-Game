# Lost-Fireflies-Mobile-Game
Short mobile game created for Final Major Project for University
On his normal nightly stroll Jerry notices that the sacred stones no longer have their fireflies. 
Jerry takes a closer look and realises all the crystals have gone missing and the fireflies have disappeared with them. 
Jerry is extremely worried that if the crystals are not returned soon then the fireflies will be gone forever.
